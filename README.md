# Industrial Machinery Monitoring with IIoT

This project simulates an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenario where industrial machinery is monitored in real-time. The system collects sensor data (RPM, oil pressure, coolant temperature, battery potential, and fuel consumption) from different machine models, processes it via MQTT, stores it in an InfluxDB database, and visualizes it on a Grafana dashboard. The goal is to ensure efficient machine management by detecting anomalies, issuing control commands, and triggering alerts when critical conditions appear.
